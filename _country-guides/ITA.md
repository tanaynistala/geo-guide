# License Plates

As a member of the EU, Italy's license plates feature a blue band on the left side of the plate with the EU circle of stars and the country code `I`. They also feature a blue band on the right side with the provincial code. Plates are white with black text: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="I" format="AB 123CD" rightBandColor="blue" />. Front plates are typically squarer and shorter, which can be used to tell Italian license plates apart from Albanian ones.
