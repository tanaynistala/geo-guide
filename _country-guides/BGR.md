# License Plates

As a member of the EU, Bulgaria's license plates feature a blue band on the left side of the plate with the EU circle of stars and the country code `BG`. Plates are white with black text: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="BG" format="AB 1234CD"/>. The first one or two letters represent the province of registration, the provincial code for which can be found in the [Subdivisions](#subdivisions) list above. Note that Sofia City exhausted all `C` codes, and so currently uses `CA` and `CB` as well.

# Roads, Markings, and Signage

# Highways & Road Numbering Schemes

The Bulgarian road network consists of motorways, of which there are currently only five; and national roads, which themselves are split into four tiers.

## Motorways

Motorways are prefixed with the letter `A`. There are currently five motorways, most of which are unfinished. They are signposted with white text on a green background, much like E-routes.

<RoadNumber style="green" number="A1" /> `W-E` from Sofia to Burgas

<RoadNumber style="green" number="A2" /> `W-E` from Sofia to Yablanitsa, continues from Shumen to Varna

<RoadNumber style="green" number="A3" /> `N-S` from Pernik to Greek border at Kulata

<RoadNumber style="green" number="A4" /> `W-E` from Plovdiv to Turkish border at Svilengrad

<RoadNumber style="green" number="A5" /> `N-S` from Varna towards Burgas (incomplete)

## National Roads

National roads form the bulk of the Bulgarian road network, and are tiered according to the number of digits in the road number. These routes are signposted with white text on a blue background.

Single-digit roads are the main national roads, and are well-organized – odd-numebred routes go north-south, with numbering increasing to the east, while even-numbered routes go east-west with numbering increasing to the south:

<RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="1" /> `N-S` Vidin-Sofia

<RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="2" /> `W-E` Ruse-Shumen-Varna

<RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="3" /> `N-S` Ruse/Veliko Tarnovo-Pleven-Botevgrad (exception to the rule)

<RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="4" /> `W-E` Veliko Tarnovo-Targovishte-Shumen

<RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="5" /> `N-S` Ruse-Veliko Tarnovo-Stara Zagora-Haskovo

<RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="6" /> `W-E` Sofia-Sliven-Burgas

<RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="7" /> `N-S` Silistra-Shumen-Yambol

<RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="8" /> `W-E` Sofia-Plovdiv-Haskovo-Svilengrad

<RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="9" /> `N-S` Varna-Burgas

Two-, three-, and four-digit national roads derive their numbers from the road they branched off from. So the following hierarchy can exist (each road number branches off of the road one tier above it):

1. <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="1" /> 
   1. <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="12" />
      1. <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="123" />
         1. <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="1234" />
      2. <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="1204" />
   2. <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="103" />
      1. <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="1034" />
   3. <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="1004" />

In the above hierarchy, roads <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="12" />, <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="103" />, and <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="1004" /> all branch off of the <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="1" />, but are of lower and lower tiers, linking smaller towns and villages. Roads <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="123" /> and <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="1204" /> branch off of the <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="12" />, but are of differing tiers as well, while <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="1234" /> is a further branch off of the <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="123" />. Meanwhile, <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="1034" /> is a branch off of the <RoadNumber style="royalblue" number="103" />

# Language

Bulgarian is the official langauge of Bulgaria, and is part of the South Slavic group of languages, bearing close resemblance to Macedonian in particular. It is written in the Cyrillic script, as Bulgaria is where the script originated.

## Script

Bulgarian uses the 30 letters of the standard Cyrillic alphabet:

> Аа Бб Вв Гг Дg Ее Жж Зз Ии Йй Кк Лл Мм Нн Оо Пп Рр Сс Тт Уу Фф Хх Цц Чч Шш Щщ Ъъ Ьь Юю Яя

However, the modern Bulgarian script typically uses a more symmetric, triangular form of the letters _Дд_ and _Лл_, shown on the right in the image below:

<img src="/img/BGR/script-differences.png" alt="Bulgarian Cyrillic vs. Traditional Cyrillic" />

## Sample

> Всички хора се раждат свободни и равни по достойнство и права. Tе са надарени с разум и съвест и следва да се отнасят помежду си в дух на братство.

# Most Similar

## [Hungary](/countries/HUN)

One feature that Bulgarian coverage shares with that of Hungary is winter coverage, which is an identifying oddity of the two countries' coverage. Both countries can also have similar architecture at times, which means the best way to tell the two apart is through language – and their scripts in particular. Bulgaria uses the Cyrillic script (see [Language](#language)), while Hungary uses the Latin alphabet.
