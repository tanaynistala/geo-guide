# License Plates

Until 2019, Senegalese license plates were blue with white text: <LicensePlate style="sen" format="AB-1234-BC" text="white" bg="blue" border="lightgray"/>. The first two letters correspond to the region code, that can be found using the [subdivisions](#subdivisions) list above.

In 2019, a new EU-style plate was introduced with white plates and a blue bar on the left featuring the Senegalese flag and country code `SN`: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="SN" format="AB∙123∙BC"/>. On these plates, the region code is not part of the registration number, but rather is printed (with the department code) on the top right corner of the plate in a smaller size.

# Phone Codes

Senegal does not have an extensive area code system, with just two codes: phone numbers starting with `8` are in Dakar, and those starting with `9` are outside of Dakar.

# Roads, Markings, and Signage
Senegal has very helpful kilometer markers. They show the road number as well as the next cities with distances. Primary (N roads) have a red top and secondary (R roads) have a green top.

Senegal uses all white road markings. They are usually dashed on the side. 

## Highways & Road Numbering Schemes
There are only 2 separated highways, the A1 from Dakar to Mbour and the A2 from Thies to Touba. The primary national Roads N1-7. They are not sorted in a reasonable way but they are generally pretty easy to find. The secondary national roads are the green R20-70. They don't show up as well as the primary roads but as there aren't many, they are findable too.

# Architecture
The only city with multi-story buildings is Dakar. In Dakar, most houses are simple apartment complexes. In the outskirts and in smaller cities, the houses aren't taller than 2, maybe 3 stories. They have flat roofs and the facades are painted in basic brown and white tones with one other colour here and there. In poorer areas, houses tend to have a cheaper look with only a brick facade. In wealthy areas or city centers some houses also have a mosaic/ornament facade.

# Meta
There are 2 camera generations, 3 and 4. On the older, rare gen 3 car, you can see rifts in the sky, as well as a roof rack. The gen 4 Cars don't have that. They are white or silver pick-up trucks. Sometimes, the Google car is entirely blurred out.

<img src="/img/SEN/senegal-car-2" alt="<Gen 4 Car 2>" /> 
<img src="/img/SEN/senegal-car-3" alt="<Gen 4 Car 3>" /> 

There are other, rarer cars. But by knowing these you should be fine!

# Electricty Poles
The Senegalese poles have a very distinct look.

# Language

French is the official language of Senegal, although it is not the most widely spoken — that crown goes to Wolof — it is the language you will encounter most often on signage.

## Script

The French language uses the 26 standard letters of the Latin alphabet, plus a variety of diacritics and some special letters:

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii
Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr
Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz
```

#### (Diacritics)

```
Àà Ââ Ææ Çç Éé Èè Êê Ëë
Îî Ïï Ôô Œœ Ùù Ûû Üü Ÿÿ
```
