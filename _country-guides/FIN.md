# License Plates

As a member of the EU, Finland's license plates feature a blue band on the left side of the plate with the EU circle of stars and the country code `FIN`. Plates are white with black text: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="FIN" format="ABC-123" borderStyle="double"/>.

# Roads, Markings, and Signage

# Highways & Road Numbering Schemes

The Finnish road network is divided into four tiers: first- (_valtatie_) and second-class (_kantatie_) main roads, regional roads (_seututie_), and connecting roads (_yhdystiet_).

## Class I Main Roads (_Valtatie_)

These are the largest highways in Finland, and are signposted with white text on a red background. They can be numbered up to 29: <RoadNumber bg="red" num="7" />. Highways 1-7 radiate outwards from Helsinki, 8-10 from Turku, and 11 and 12 start in Tampere. There is no discernible pattern to the numbering of the remaining routes, but they typically connect large cities together.

## Class II Main Roads (_Kantatie_)

These highways complement the Class I main roads, and are signposted with black text on a yellow background. They can be numbered between 40 and 93: <RoadNumber bg="gold" border="black" num="45" />. There is some clustering of the numbering system, and it generally increases to the north and to the east.

## Regional and Connecting Roads (_Maantie_)

These are more minor roads that are mostly regional. They can have either three or four digits, and the two kinds are signed differently. 3-digit roads are called _seututie_, and are signposted with black text on a white background: <RoadNumber bg="white" num="123" />. 4-digit roads are called _yhdystie_, and are signposted with white text on a blue background: <RoadNumber bg="royalblue" num="1234" />. _Yhdystie_ numbers are usually derived from a nearby _seututie_ number by adding a digit onto the end, so route <RoadNumber bg="royalblue" num="1456" /> branches off route <RoadNumber bg="white" num="145" />.

These routes are roughly organized by region, but can spill over into neighboring areas. Here are the regions, by the first digit:

1. South
2. Southwest
3. Central-East
4. Southeast
5. East
6. Central-West
7. Northwest
8. North
9. Far North / Lapland

## Helsinki Ring Roads

Helsinki has three ring roads that are signposted with Roman numerals. Since Helsinki is bilingual, these signs bear both the words _Kehä_ `FI` and _Ring_ `SE`, followed by the Roman numeral `I`, `II`, or `III`. However, these ring routes aren't shown on the map, instead using their traditional route number:

1. Ring I: <RoadNumber border="black" num="101" />
2. Ring II: <RoadNumber border="black" num="102" />
3. Ring III: <RoadNumber bg="gold" border="black" num="50" />

# Language

Finland has two official languages: Finnish and Swedish. Swedish bears many similarities to other Scandinavian languages like Danish and Norwegian, but Finnish, as a Uralic language, is vastly different from most European languages. It is most similar to Estonian, another Finnic Uralic language, and bears slightly less similarities to Hungarian, which is also Uralic but on a different branch. Finnish is characterized by the frequent presence of double vowels, especially of _A_ and _O_.

## Script

Finnish is written using the Latin alphabet, plus five additional characters:

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj
Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt
Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz Åå Ää Öö Šš Žž
```

Only _Ä_ and _Ö_ are frequently used in Finnish; _Å_ is mainly used for Swedish names, while _Š_ and _Ž_ are used rarely, typically in loanwords. _B_, _C_, _F_, _Q_, _W_, _X_, _Z_, _Å_, _Š_, and _Ž_ are reserved for foreign words.

The Swedish alphabet is similar, using all the same characters except _Š_ and _Ž_.

## Samples

### Finnish

> Kaikki ihmiset syntyvät vapaina ja tasavertaisina arvoltaan ja oikeuksiltaan. Heille on annettu järki ja omatunto, ja heidän on toimittava toisiaan kohtaan veljeyden hengessä.

### Swedish

> Alla människor är födda fria och lika i värdighet och rättigheter. De är utrustade med förnuft och samvete och bör handla gentemot varandra i en anda av broderskap.
