We GeoGuessr players love to explore the world. There's no doubt about that. But the default world map can get stale after a while. Either you've gotten Dubai for the 7th time in as many games, or those pesky photospheres have popped up one too many times — here are the best world maps to play to get away from the frustrations:

## [A Diverse World](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/59a1514f17631e74145b6f47)

Almost certainly the most popular user-created map in GeoGuessr, this map is the de-facto world map for the players who've sworn off the default world map. After all, over eleven million people have played it. Play on for a very fair mix of locations across the world!

## [A Community World](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/62a44b22040f04bd36e8a914)

One of the newest maps on this list, this map is (as the name suggests) a community-made map featuring over 100,000 locations submitted by over a hundred players and mapmakers. That means all its locations are handpicked, and some locations are sure to pose a good challenge or give you a chuckle.

## [A Balanced World](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/5d73f83d82777cb5781464f2)

As the name suggests, this map was made to balance out the difficulty and spread of locations across the globe. And it's got a bunch of cool architecture, unusual vegetation, and strange rocks — map creator Debre's words, not mine.

## [An Improved World](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/5b0a80f8596695b708122809)

An Improved World delivers on its promise with nearly 100,000 handpicked locations to minimize your chance of repeats, and is additionally suited for No Move (NM) and NMPZ games.

## [An Arbitrary World](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/6089bfcff6a0770001f645dd)

Despite its name, An Arbitrary World features a very carefully balanced selection of computer-generated locations, both on a global scale and a regional scale.

## [AI Generated World](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/5dbaf08ed0d2a478444d2e8e)

You're at the mercy of the RNG gods on this map, as its locations were entirely picked by an AI that (hopefully) will never take over the world.

## [A Stochastic Populated World](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/61f5026376f7be0001e1eb84)

That's okay, you can look up what stochastic means. This map features locations "packed proportionally to population density" - so be prepared for the inevitable East and Southeast Asia rounds and the occasional Manhattan one.

## For The Picky Ones

These maps cater to only the pickiest of players, who know what they want out of a world map.

## [A Rural World](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/5be0de51fe3a84037ca36447)

Pretty self-explanatory. If you hate looking for locations in the endless sprawl of cities, this map ensures that you'll never get any of those locations again. Play it NMPZ for even more torture, given map creator TOPOTIC's affinity for bait-y locations.

## [An Urban World](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/5b3d510b7a2b425ef47b54fd)

The polar opposite of the previous pick, this map places you in urban areas across the globe, from the same person who brought you [A Diverse World](#a-diverse-world)

## [Urbanguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/5b0a4b154559f41f70bba679)

An alternative urban map, this one features a much more expansive set of locations, mad ejust for those of you who just _hate_ being stuck out in the middle of a field or forest.

## For The Pinpointers

These maps are made just for those of you who will try to get the 5k at all costs.

### [IntersectionGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/61325442eadbec00018b6385)

My personal favorite, this one features 100,000 autogenerated locations spread across the world, all at locations where two roads meet. Fair warning: the map is sourced from OpenStreetMap, so some intersections may not show up on Google Maps.

### [A Pinpointable World](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/5d73f83d82777cb5781464f2)

This one features a much smaller location set than IntersectionGuessr, but is perfect for those who want to work on their pinpointing game. Thousands of curated pinpointable locations await you — let's just hope you don't have to spend all day looking for one of them.

## Honorable Mentions

### [A Hard World](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/5ddefcd244d2a461885f442e)

This map promises to be difficult, and features some of the most difficult countries featured on Street View. However, it can be pretty Southeast Asia-heavy at times. Play at your own risk.

## [A Skewed World](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/6165f7176c26ac00016bca3d)

This map is made specifically for NMPZ games, with a skewed coverage (as the name suggests). It just means you're likely to get locations in the same regions.
