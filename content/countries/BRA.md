# Traffic

## Signage

Brazilian signage is notable mainly for having a black backing and a cross-brace on the back of the sign, which makes it easily identifiable.

### Priority & General Signage

Brazilian signage largely follows the US-standard specification, with text in Portuguese. This includes diamond-shaped warning signs, octagonal stop signs, and triangular yield signs. The exception is speed limit signs, which are circular.

| Purpose        | Sign                                                                                                                               |

# Language

Portuguese is the primary language used in Brazil, and is linguistically closest to Spanish, the predominant language in the rest of South and Central America. It is characterized by its frequent use of the letters H and Ç as compared to Spanish, as well as tilde (~) diacritics.

## Script

Portuguese uses the 26 standard letters of the Latin alphabet, five diacritics, and has seven common digraphs:

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii
Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr
Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz
```

### Diacritics

```
Áá Éé Íí Óó Úú Àà
Ââ Êê Ôô Ãã Õõ Çç
```

### Digraphs

```
ch lh nh rr ss qu gu
```

## Sample

> Todos os seres humanos nascem livres e iguais em dignidade e em direitos. Dotados de razão e de consciência, devem agir uns para com os outros em espírito de fraternidade.
