Welcome to the biggest of Portugal's excolonies - Brazil. It is famous for having those long straight roads in the middle of nowhere. If you are lucky, you can find a roadnumer on a kilometermarker. And if you are even more lucky, you found one of the precious and insanely helpful areacodes. Next to knowing cyrillic, this is probably one of the most important things to know as a Geoguessr player. Good luck trying to master Brazil!

# Traffic

## Signage

One of the best giveaways for Brazil is the black sign backs (see image). This, combined with the yellow road lines is an almost guaranteed Brazil plonk.
<img src="/img/BRA/Bildschirmfoto 2022-12-07 um 16.03.02.png" alt="<Black Sign-back>" /> 


### Priority & General Signage

Brazilian signage largely follows the US-standard specification, with text in Portuguese. This includes diamond-shaped warning signs, octagonal stop signs, and triangular yield signs. The exception is speed limit signs, which are circular.

| Purpose        | Sign                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Bollards and poles
Brazil uses mostly 2 kinds of poles:
1. The classic 'ladder poles' found all over Brazil.
2. Big, round poles found generally around São Paulo

<img src="/img/BRA/Bildschirmfoto 2022-12-07 um 16.04.05.png" alt="<Round Pole>" /> 

Bollards are an uncommon sight in South America. If you see any, you are more likely to be in Ecuador or even Peru.

# Geography

A gigantic country like Brazil has tons of different landscapes. Landscape guessing is one of the harder things to do in Brazil. Here are some tips:

## Vegetation

The most famous plant of Brazil is probably the Parana-pine. It is mostly found in and around Parana.

<img src="/img/BRA/parana_pine.png" alt="<Parana Pine>" /> 

Tocantins and Mato Grosso are famous for having red dirt. But be careful, thereare many exceptions.

<img src="/img/BRA/red_dirt.png" alt="<Red Dirt>" /> 

In the north-west, starting from Minas Gerais going north, you can find a lot of these shrubs. Be careful, in summer-coverage they may look differently becuase of the leaves.

<img src="/img/BRA/northern_shrubs.p" alt="<Shrubs>" /> 

In the Amazon rainforest you can find classic examples of tropical plants. They often look similar to Ecuador, Colombia and Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.

## Relief

The relief is actually quite helpful in Brazil. As you can see on the map, mountains are usually a more coastal thing.

# Architecture

Houses on stilts are often found in Acre and Rondonia. 

<img src="/img/BRA/acre_stilts.png" alt="<Acre Stilts>" /> 

In the north, especially in Maranhão the houses are strongly influenced by the Portuguese settlers. They often have tiled roofs and white facades.

# Language

Portuguese is the primary language used in Brazil, and is linguistically closest to Spanish, the predominant language in the rest of South and Central America. It is characterized by its frequent use of the letters H and Ç as compared to Spanish, as well as tilde (~) diacritics. Also you often see the letters 'nh' combinated. The word 'e' means 'and' which is different from the Spanish 'y'

## Script

Portuguese uses the 26 standard letters of the Latin alphabet, five diacritics, and has seven common digraphs:

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii
Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr
Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz
```

### Diacritics

```
Áá Éé Íí Óó Úú Àà
Ââ Êê Ôô Ãã Õõ Çç
```

### Digraphs

```
ch lh nh rr ss qu gu
```

## Sample

> Todos os seres humanos nascem livres e iguais em dignidade e em direitos. Dotados de razão e de consciência, devem agir uns para com os outros em espírito de fraternidade.
