# Highways & Road Numbering Schemes

The Latvian road numbering system splits roads into three tiers – main, first-class, and second-class – although only the first two are usually signposted.

## Main Roads (_Autocela_)

These routes are usually signposted with the letter A and up to two digits in white text on a red background: <RoadNumber num="A12" bgColor="red" />. A1-A3 and A6-A10 are radial roads out of Riga, arranged clockwise, while A4 and A5 form a partial ring route around Riga. A11 is the coastal route south of Liepāja, A12 branches off to the east from Jēkabpils, and A13-A15 form connector roads between and around Daugavpils and Rēzekne.

## First-Class Roads

These routes are usually signposted with the letter P and up to three digits in white text on a blue background: <RoadNumber num="P123" bgColor="dodgerblue" />. These roads are not very well-ordered but are loosely clustered and seem to increase in number going clockwise around Riga, although there are exceptions.

# Language

Latvian is the primary language used in Latvia, and is one of two major Baltic languages in use today (the other being Lithuanian). It is fairly unique compared to other European languages, as Baltic languages occupy their own branch of the Indo-European language family.

## Script

Latvian uses 33 characters, including 22 letters of the standard Latin alphabet (all except _Q_, _W_, _X_, and _Y_):

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh
Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo
Pp Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Zz
```

The remaining eleven characters are nearly all unique to Latvian, being modified versions of other Latin characters. In particular, note the use of macrons on vowels, which is unique to Latvia.

> Āā Čč Ēē Ģģ Īī Ķķ Ļļ Ņņ Šš Ūū Žž

## Sample

> Visi cilvēki piedzimst brīvi un vienlīdzīgi savā pašcieņā un tiesībās. Viņi ir apveltīti ar saprātu un sirdsapziņu, un viņiem jāizturas citam pret citu brālības garā.
