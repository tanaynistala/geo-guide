# License Plates

License plates in Colombia are typically yellow with black text and borders: <LicensePlate style="other" format="ABC·123" bgColor="gold" borderColor="black"/>. Commercial plates have white backgrounds instead: <LicensePlate style="other" format="ABC·123" borderColor="black"/>. Both types of plates also have the department of issuance embossed on the bottom, and commercial vehicles are also required to print the license plate on the side of the vehicle. This "third" license plate is not usually blurred, and so can be used easily to find your location.

# Phone Codes

Phone codes in Colombia are organized by department, but are also prefixed with carrier codes that can make it difficult to identify the area code. However, counting from the end of the phone number, the area code is the 8th last digit (i.e. there are seven digits after it).

1. **Central**
   - Bogotá
   - Cundinamarca
2. **Southwest**
   - Cauca
   - Valle del Cauca
   - Nariño

# Language

Spanish is the official language of Colombia, and is the language you will encounter most often. Several indigenous languages are also recognized as regional languages, but are not commonly encountered. It is characterized by its use of the tilde on top of an N, and the use of inverted punctuation at the beginning of phrases. The exception is the San Andrés y Providencia, where English is an official language.

## Script

Spanish uses the 26 standard letters of the Latin alphabet, plus one extra character (`Ññ`):

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii
Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Ññ Oo Pp Qq
Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz
```

In addition, Spanish employs the acute accent over vowels:

```
Áá Éé Íí Óó Úú
```

Spanish is also notable for using inverted exclamation and question marks at the beginning of their respective phrases:

```
¡...!
¿...?
```

## Sample

> Todos los seres humanos nacen libres e iguales en dignidad y derechos y, dotados como están de razón y conciencia, deben comportarse fraternalmente los unos con los otros.
