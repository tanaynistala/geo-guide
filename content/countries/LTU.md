# Highways & Road Numbering Schemes

Lithuania has a three-tiered road numbering system with main (magistralinis), regional (krasto), and municipal (rajoniniu) roads.

## Main roads (_Magistralinis kelias_)

These highways are the highest tier of the Lithuanian highway network, and mostly exist on top of the E-road network. They are signposted with white text on a red background <RoadNumber num="A12" bgColor="red" />, and the number is often shown with the E-road number. A1-A4 radiate outwards from Vilius, arranged clockwise. A5-A13 are further west and north, with larger numbers being further away from Vilnius. A14-A16 are upgraded regional roads from Vilnius, and the A17-A19 are partial ring routes around Panevėžys, Šiauliai, and Vilnius, respectively.

## Regional Roads (_Krasto kelias_)

These are smaller routes, and are numbered starting from 101 around Vilnius, and generally increase going west and north, although there are some higher numbers to the southwest of Vilnius. Most are numbered in the 100s, although there are a few in the 200s, mostly in the northwest. They are signposted with black text on a yellow background: <RoadNumber num="123" bgColor="gold" borderColor="black" />.

## Municipal Roads (_Rajoniniu kelias_)

These are the lowest tier of the Lithuanian road network, but are not organized very well. Numbered with up to 4 digits, those beginning with a one (1) are mostly in the center or the east, those beginning with a two (2) are mainly in the west, but 3-, 4-, and 5-series highways are spread out all across the country. They are signposted with white text on a blue background: <RoadNumber num="1234" bgColor="blue" />.

# Language

Lithuanian is the primary language used in Lithuania, and is one of two major Baltic languages in use today (the other being Latvian). It is fairly unique compared to other European languages, as Baltic languages occupy their own branch of the Indo-European language family.

## Script

The Lithuanian alphabet consists of 32 letters, including 23 of the standard Latin alphabet, five digraphs, and several versions of traditional characters with diacritics:

```
Aa Ąą Bb Cc Čč Dd Ee Ęę Ėė Ff Gg
Hh Ii Įį Yy Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo
Pp Rr Ss Tt Uu Ųų Ūū Vv Zz Žž
```

### (Digraphs)

```
ch dz dž ie uo
```

## Sample

> Visi žmonės gimsta laisvi ir lygūs savo orumu ir teisėmis. Jiems suteiktas protas ir sąžinė ir jie turi elgtis vienas kito atžvilgiu kaip broliai.
