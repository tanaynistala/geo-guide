# License Plates

License plates in Ecuador are typically white with black text: <LicensePlate style="other" format="ABC-123" borderColor="black"/>. The first character corresponds to the province of issuance, the codes for which can be found in the [subdivisions](#subdivisions) list above. `ECUADOR` is printed on top of the license plate. Older commercial plates had an orange background, which can sometimes be seen.

# Language

Spanish is the official language of Ecuador, and is the language you will encounter most often. Several indigenous languages are also recognized as regional languages, but are not commonly encountered. It is characterized by its use of the tilde on top of an N, and the use of inverted punctuation at the beginning of phrases.

## Script

Spanish uses the 26 standard letters of the Latin alphabet, plus one extra character (`Ññ`):

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii
Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Ññ Oo Pp Qq
Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz
```

In addition, Spanish employs the acute accent over vowels:

```
Áá Éé Íí Óó Úú
```

Spanish is also notable for using inverted exclamation and question marks at the beginning of their respective phrases:

```
¡...!
¿...?
```

## Sample

> Todos los seres humanos nacen libres e iguales en dignidad y derechos y, dotados como están de razón y conciencia, deben comportarse fraternalmente los unos con los otros.
