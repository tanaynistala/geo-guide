- Keelung City `基隆市`
- Kinmen county `金門縣`
- Lienchiang county `連江縣`
- Miaoli county `苗栗縣`
- Nantou county `南投縣`
- Penghu county `澎湖縣`
- Pingtung county `屏東縣`
- Taitung county `臺東縣`

- Yunlin county `雲林縣`

##6 special municipalities

- New Taipei City `新北市`

To learn the cities and counties you can use the [Seterra quiz](https://www.geoguessr.com/seterra/en/vgp/3273) and the [City quiz](https://super-duper.fr/country/quizz_cities_en.php).

# Geography

Taïwan has a main island and quite a few secondary islands, some of which are quite near continental China.
<img src="/img/TWN/islands.png" alt="map of Taïwan islands" />
The Chungyang mountain range (Zhongyang shanmo in chinese) covers the center and eastern part of the main island.
All the islands have streetview coverage except the small Wuqiu islands.

# Roads, Markings, and Signage

## road types

There are 4 types of roads in Taïwan :

- National freeways : <RoadNumber style="flower" num="1" borderColor="green" bgColor="white"/>
- Regional highways :<RoadNumber style="tri" num="1" bgColor="blue"/> or <RoadNumber style="tri" num="60" bgColor="red"/>
- County roads : white square.
- Township roads : they have a county symbol in front of their number.
  <img src="/img/TWN/roads.png" alt="road types in Taïwan" />
  A road can be split in different sections, identified by a symbol after the number. For example road <RoadNumber style="tri" num="7甲" bgColor="blue"/> has several branches like <RoadNumber style="tri" num="7丙" bgColor="blue"/> and , which is the equivalent of road 7A and road 7C.
  <img src="../img/TWN/subroads.png" alt="road subsections in Taïwan" />

## National freeways

National freeways are numbered <RoadNumber style="flower" num="1" borderColor="green" bgColor="white"/> to <RoadNumber style="flower" num="10" borderColor="green" bgColor="white"/>. Every 100m, there s a kilometer sign telling you the distance with the north end of the road for north-south roads, or the west end of the road for east-west roads. Exit numbers also match this same distance.
<img src="/img/TWN/national_highways.png" alt="national freeways in Taïwan" />

## Regional highways

On the map, the triangle logo appears in blue, unless the number is 60+ in which case they appear in red. Beware, the color on the map doesnt necessarily match the color in the streetview.  
Some noteworthy regional highways :

- <RoadNumber style="tri" num="1" bgColor="blue"/> and <RoadNumber style="tri" num="3" bgColor="blue"/> follow the west coast.
- <RoadNumber style="tri" num="2" bgColor="blue"/> follows the north coast. -<RoadNumber style="tri" num="9" bgColor="blue"/> and <RoadNumber style="tri" num="11" bgColor="blue"/> follow the east coast.
  There is no global order but here are a few tricks : <RoadNumber style="tri" num="2" bgColor="blue"/>/<RoadNumber style="tri" num="4" bgColor="blue"/>/<RoadNumber style="tri" num="6" bgColor="blue"/>... until <RoadNumber style="tri" num="26" bgColor="blue"/> go from north to south, <RoadNumber style="tri" num="60's" bgColor="red"/> roads are rather north, <RoadNumber style="tri" num="70's" bgColor="red"/> rather center, and <RoadNumber style="tri" num="80's" bgColor="red"/> rather south.

## County roads

They range from <RoadNumber bgColor="white" borderColor="black" num="101" /> in the north to <RoadNumber bgColor="white" borderColor="black" num="200" /> in the south of the main island. Roads <RoadNumber bgColor="white" borderColor="black" num="201" /> to <RoadNumber bgColor="white" borderColor="black" num="205" /> are in Penghu county.

## Township roads

Township roads have a symbol in front of their number, it looks like this : <RoadNumber bgColor="white" borderColor="black" num="市12" />.
You can learn the symbols with the [township roads quiz Taïwan](https://super-duper.fr/country/quiz_taiwan_roads_en.php), but you can also find them by scanning the map. Indeed, the road symbol is one of the first 2 symbols of the county name :

Exception : Keelung city, Hsinchu city et Chiaoyi city all use the 市 symbol which simply means "city".

# Phone codes

In Taïwan, area codes range from 02 in the north to 08 in the south. 09 is for cell phone numbers.
<img src="/img/TWN/areacodes.png" alt="map of phone area codes in Taïwan" />
You can learn them with the [area codes quiz](https://super-duper.fr/country/quizz_tel_en.php?country=TW).

# Electric poles

## Recognize taïwanese electric poles

The main characteristic of taïwanese electric poles are the black and yellow diagonal stripes at the bottom. The stripes are :

- similar to the japanese ones, except the japanese stripes are vertical.
- the same as the korean stripes, except in taïwan they go all the way down to the ground.

<img src="/img/TWN/electric pole.png" alt="Township road" />

other characteristic that are found on many (but not all) electric poles include :

- a blue plaque
- a sticker, which could be either vertical or horizontal, and either yellow or green. The sticker has a big number written on it.

## Electric poles geolocation system

### Find the coordinates

On the main island, there is a blue plaque screwed to many of the electric poles.
<img src="/img/TWN/blue_plaque.png" alt="blue plaque on Taïwan electric poles" />
The string "E3264 BE08" on the image is the location of the pole in a coordinate system specific to the Taïwan power grid, which indicates the location of electric pole with a 10 meter precision.

### The theory

We take our example "E3264 BE08", and read left to right.
The most important information is letter E, which gives us a 50 km by 80 km rectangle.
<img src="../img/TWN/twd67.png" alt="map of Taïwan power grid coordinates system" />
The second most important information is "3264", it tells us that within rectangle E, we are 32% eastward and 64% northward.
<img src="../img/TWN/twd67bis.png" alt="detail of Taïwan power grid coordinates" />
The string "BE08" is for precision but it is of no practical use ingame.
If you want to know more about this coordinate system, this [wiki page](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Taiwan_Power_Company_grid) explains how to translate them in TWD67 coordinate system, which can then be converted in classic [WGS84 coordinates](https://mygeodata.cloud/cs2cs/).

### Practical use

You can train with the [Taïwan power grid coordinates geoguessr map](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/630f95ff91121015c983c4a0) and the [Taïwan power grid quiz](https://super-duper.fr/country/quiz_taiwanpower_en.php).
Once you know the repartition of the letters, remembering 6 or 7 points is good enough to recreate the whole grid.
<img src="/img/TWN/grid.png" alt="recreating the grid" />
The easiest landmarks are :

- B slightly north of Hsinchu, C in Jiaoxi.
- F in Nanao township, on the west coast the border between Miaoli county and Hsinchu city is on the same horizontal.
- H is near Puli, where the google map indicates either Taïwan or Nantou county depending on the zoom.
- K is n the west coast at the border between Yunlin county and Chiayo county.
- N is just north of Tainan city, on the same horizontal you find Guanshan.
- R is in Taïmali.
