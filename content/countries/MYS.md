## road types

There are 3 types of roads :
1. Expressways E.
2. Federal roads with just a simple number.
3. Regional roads with a letter then a number.

## Expressways E

Most of them are in Selangor region, around Kuala Lumpur, there are also a few in Johor near Singapore.
Only 3 exceptions : <RoadNumber style="long-hex" num="E1" bgColor="yellow"/>, <RoadNumber style="long-hex" num="E2" bgColor="yellow"/> and <RoadNumber style="long-hex" num="E8" bgColor="yellow"/>.

## Federal roads

Roads with a simple number are federal roads, there are very few of them on Malaysian Borneo : only roads <RoadNumber style="long-hex" num="1" bgColor="yellow"/>,<RoadNumber style="long-hex" num="13" bgColor="yellow"/>, <RoadNumber style="long-hex" num="22" bgColor="yellow"/> and <RoadNumber style="long-hex" num="5xx" bgColor="yellow"/>. But roads <RoadNumber style="long-hex" num="1" bgColor="yellow"/> and <RoadNumber style="long-hex" num="13" bgColor="yellow"/> are not unique, there is also a <RoadNumber style="long-hex" num="1" bgColor="yellow"/> and a <RoadNumber style="long-hex" num="13" bgColor="yellow"/> in Peninsular Malaysia.

## Regional roads

Regional roads start with a letter. Each state has its own letter, but both Perlis and Sabah use the letter R.

- Usually, signposts on Peninsular Malaysia will specify the road numbers, while signposts on Malaysian Borneo do not.
- You will almost never see bollards on Malaysian Borneo.
