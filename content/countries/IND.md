Welcome to one of the longest-awaited additions to Street View: India! This incredibly diverse country is a whole new world all on its own; read on to learn more about it!

# Subdivisions

India is comprised of 28 states:

- Andhra Pradesh `AP`
- Arunachal Pradesh `AR`
- Assam `AS`
- Bihar `BR`
- Chhatisgarh `CG`
- Goa `GA`
- Gujarat `GJ`
- Haryana `HR`
- Himachal Pradesh `HP`
- Jharkhand `JH`
- Karnataka `KA`
- Kerala `KL`
- Madhya Pradesh `MP`
- Maharashtra `MH`
- Manipur `MN`
- Meghalaya `ML`
- Mizoram `MZ`
- Nagaland `NL`
- Odisha `OR`/`OD`
- Punjab `PB`
- Rajasthan `RJ`
- Sikkim `SK`
- Tamil Nadu `TN`
- Telangana `TS`
- Tripura `TR`
- Uttar Pradesh `UP`
- Uttarakhand `UA`/`UK`
- West Bengal `WB`

and 8 Union Territories:

- Andaman and Nicobar Islands `AN`
- Chandigarh `CH`
- Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu `DN`/`DD`
- Delhi `DL`
- Jammu and Kashmir `JK`
- Ladakh `LA`
- Lakshadweep `LD`
- Puducherry/Pondicherry `PY`

Odisha and Uttarakhand were renamed from Orissa and Uttaranchal, respectively, which is why two state codes are provided. Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu were previously two separate Union Territories, and codes for both are provided above, although today only the latter (`DD`) continues on. Telangana split off from Andhra Pradesh, so `AP` can still be found on signs in the area.

# License Plates

License plate designs in India are not strictly regulated, although there are primarily two types of license plates. Private vehicles carry white-backed license plates with black text: <LicensePlate style="ind" format="AB 12 CD 3456"/>, while commercial vehicles (taxis, trucks, government vehicles, etc.) carry yellow-backed license plates with black text: <LicensePlate style="ind" format="AB 12 CD 3456" bgColor="gold"/>. Occasionally these colors can be inverted, most commonly on luxury cars and higher-ranking government vehicles, or can be found using the local script (see [Language](#language)).

Indian license plates follow a simple format that can make it easy to narrow down your location if you find an unblurred plate:

1. The first two characters correspond to the state code (see [Subdivisions](#subdivisions))
2. The next two characters correspond to the region the car was registered in, numbered by state
   - The exception to this rule is Delhi, where only the first character corresponds to this. The second character corresponds to the vehicle's class
3. The next three to six characters are the vehicle's registered serial number, comprised of two letters and up to four numbers.

While most license plates will be blurred, the sheer density of vehicles in urban areas means some are likely to be missed, or only partially blurred. In addition, auto rickshaws and taxis often have their license plate printed on the side of the vehicle as well, which is often not blurred. Thus this makes it easier to narrow down your location.

## Western MH & Vadodara/Baroda

As the most densely covered area on Street View (as of early August 2022), knowing the registration codes for `MH` vehicles can help narrow down which city you are in. Vadodara/Baroda is the only covered city in this region not in Maharashtra state – it will predominantly have `GJ` plates, from Gujarat. Here are the registration codes for the other cities (all prefixed with `MH` on license plates):

- Mumbai: `01`-`05`, `46`-`48`, `55`, `56`
- Pune: `12`, `14`, `53`, `54`
- Nashik: `15`
- Ahmednagar: `16`, `17`

# Phone Codes

India uses different systems for mobile and telephone numbers. Mobile phone numbers are organized by carrier, and thus are not particularly useful in narrowing down your location. However, telephone codes, while slightly harder to find, can help you narrow down your location. These numbers are sometimes prefixed with a zero (0).

1. North (`JK`, `HP`, `CH`, `PB`, `HR`, `UA`, `DL`, northern `RJ`)
2. West (`GJ`, `DD`, western `MH`, western `RJ`)
3. Northeast (`WB`, `SK`, `AS`, `ML`, `AR`, `AS`, `NL`, `MN`, `TR`, `MZ`, `AN`)
4. South (`KL`, `TN`, `PY`, `LA`, Hyderabad `TS`)
5. North (`UP`)
6. East (`OR`, `JH`, `BR`)
7. Central (`MP`, `CG`, eastern `MH`, southern `RJ`, Ahmedabad `GJ`)
8. South (`AP`, `TS`, `GA`, `KA`)

# Roads, Markings, and Signage

Roads in India aren't marked very consistently – while they typically sport white lines, they are often missing altogether. However, main roads often have planted dividers in the middle, mainly in or near cities. These are particularly distinctive, as they feature alternating yellow and black stripes, as do the curbs.

Road signs in India often feature English text in addition to the local language/script, although the English text can vary from being a transliteration to an old name. Shops almost always have their address written on the sign (like in Sri Lanka or Bangladesh), but aren't always written in English. Try comparing the scripts (see [Language](#language)) to figure out the region, and match the characters to a city.

Mumbai in particular uses a directional system to neighborhood names, which are suffixed with _East_ (पूर्व) or _West_ (पश्चिम) corresponding to whether you are east or west of the nearest railway line. Look out for these indicators (typically just the first character) to figure out where to look!

# Language

India is home to a variety of languages, being home to about six independent language families, and 23 official languages. Many have their own scripts, especially those in the south of the country. The following are the most prominent languages, and the ones most likely to be encountered in GeoGuessr. Where otherwise noted, the script for each language is known by the same name as the language itself.

- English (Latin)
- Hindi (Devanagari)
  - `RJ`, `HR`, `UK`, `HP`, `UP`, `MP`, `CG`, `JH`, `BR`, `DL`, `CH`
- Marathi (Devanagari)
  - `MH`
- Bengali
  - `WB`, `AN`, `TR`
- Telugu
  - `TS`, `AP`
- Tamil
  - `TN`, `PY`
- Gujarati
  - `GJ`, `DD`
- Kannada
  - `KA`
- Malayalam
  - `KL`
- Odia
  - `OD`

All of these languages except English are written in _abugida_ scripts, and can have in excess of 500 individual character combinations of consonants and vowel diacritics. See [Samples](#samples) to see how these scripts look.

# Meta-gaming

Street View in India has been a bit of a roller coaster ride, if we’re being honest. But in late July 2022, Google officially rolled out official street view coverage in partnership with various local companies. Due to government regulations, Google was required to use imagery captured by local companies, resulting in a lower resolution than you’re used to seeing in other South Asian countries, like Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka. This can help you tell India apart from those two countries, especially in the cities of Chennai and Kolkata, which each use the same script as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, respectively (see [Language](#language)).

As of late August 2022, coverage in India is limited to about 32 cities (not including cities within the Mumbai and Delhi metropolitan areas):

### West

- Ahmedabad `GJ`
- Anand `GJ`
- Bharuch `GJ`
- Mumbai Metro
  - Mumbai `MH`
  - Navi Mumbai `MH`
  - Thane `MH`
  - Kalyan `MH`
  - Bhiwandi `MH`
  - Dombivli `MH`
- Nashik `MH`
- Pune `MH`
- Surat `GJ`
- Vadodara `GJ`

### Central

- Ahmednagar `MH`
- Aurangabad `MH`
- Chandrapur `MH`
- Malegaon `MH`
- Nagpur `MH`
- Nanded `MH`
- Solapur `MH`

### South

- Bengaluru `KA`
- Chennai `TN`
- Hyderabad `TS`
- Srikakulam `AP`
- Visakhapatnam `AP`

### North

- Amritsar `PB`
- Chandigarh `CH`
- Dehradun `UA`
- Delhi Metro
  - New Delhi `DL`
  - Gurugram `HR`
  - Faridabad `HR`
  - Noida `UP`
  - Ghaziabad `UP`
- Jalandhar `PB`
- Ludhiana `PB`
- Meerut `UP`

### East

- Gorakhpur `UP`
- Kanpur `UP`
- Lucknow `UP`
- Prayagraj `UP`
- Varanasi `UP`

This means most coverage is concentrated in two places: on the west coast between Pune and Ahmedabad, and northwards from Delhi.

# Most Similar

## [Bangladesh](/countries/BGD)

Bangladesh's official language is Bengali – the same as `WB`, `AN`, and `TR`. This means they can feature the same script. To tell them apart, pay attention to the car – the Bangladeshi Google car often has bars and red side-view mirrors, and with newer Generation 4 coverage has much higher-resolution coverage than India.

## [Sri Lanka](/countries/LKA)

Tamil is one of the official languages of Sri Lanka, predominantly spoken in the Northern and Eastern provinces, as well as the southern portion of Central province. Tamil is also spoken in Tamil Nadu, and with the introduction of coverage in Chennai this can make identifying the region difficult. In Sri Lanka, be on the lookout for Sinhalese, as it is only found in Sri Lanka. India also has white license plates, while both countries have yellow ones as well – so a white plate is a surefire indicator that you are in India.
