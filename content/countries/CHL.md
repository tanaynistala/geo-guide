# Subdivisions

Chile is divided into 16 regions, or _regiones_, each assigned a Roman numeral that generally increases from north to south:

1. Tarapacá `I`
2. Antofagasta `II`
3. Atacama `III`
4. Coquimbo `IV`
5. Valparaíso `V`
6. O'Higgins `VI`
7. Maule `VII`
8. Biobío `VIII`
9. Araucanía `IX`
10. Los Lagos `X`
11. Aysén `XI`
12. Magallanes `XII`
13. Metropolitan `RM`
14. Los Ríos `XIV`
15. Arica y Parinacota `XV`
16. Ñuble `XVI`

The Metropolitan Region, which contains Santiago, is the only one that doesn't use its Roman Numeral, instead using the code `RM`.

# Language

Spanish is the national language of Chile, and is the language you will encounter most often. It is characterized by its use of the tilde on top of an N, and the use of inverted punctuation at the beginning of phrases.

## Script

Spanish uses the 26 standard letters of the Latin alphabet, plus one extra character (`Ññ`):

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii
Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Ññ Oo Pp Qq
Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz
```

In addition, Spanish employs the acute accent over vowels:

```
Áá Éé Íí Óó Úú
```

Spanish is also notable for using inverted exclamation and question marks at the beginning of their respective phrases:

```
¡...!
¿...?
```

## Sample

> Todos los seres humanos nacen libres e iguales en dignidad y derechos y, dotados como están de razón y conciencia, deben comportarse fraternalmente los unos con los otros.
