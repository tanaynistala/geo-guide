# License Plates

Albania's license plates feature a blue band on both sides of the plate. The left band contains the Albanian coat of arms and the country code `AL`, while the right band contains registration information. Plates are white with black text: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="AL" format="AB 123 CD" rightBandColor="blue"/>. Unlike Italian license plates, the front plates are not smaller than the rear plates.

# Language

Albanian is the official language of Albania, and is very distinctive compared to other languages in the region. As such, it occupies its own branch in the Indo-European family, and is very easy to recognize.

## Script

Albanian uses 25 standard letters of the Latin alphabet (_W_ excepted), plus two accented letters and nine digraphs:

```
Aa Bb Cc Çç Dd Ee Ëë Ff Gg
Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp
Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Xx Yy Zz
```

### Digraphs

```
dh gj ll nj rr sh th xh zh

```

## Sample

In the sample below, note the frequent use of *e*s with umlauts, as well as the digraphs listed above:

> Të gjithë njerëzit lindin të lirë dhe të barabartë në dinjitet dhe në të drejta. Ata kanë arsye dhe ndërgjegje dhe duhet të sillen ndaj njëri tjetrit me frymë vëllazërimi.
