# Language

The Icelandic language is the official language of Iceland, and is most closely related to Faroese. Its relative isolation means it is very distinctive, especially from mainland European languages; the written form of Icelandic is similar only to Faroese, with which it shares one of two unique letters.

## Script

The Icelandic alphabet contains two letters that no longer exist in the English alphabet: thorn (_Þþ_) and edh/eth (_Ðð_). Thorn is unique to Icelandic, while edh/eth is shared with Faroese.
