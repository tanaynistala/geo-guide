# License Plates

As a member of the EU, Estonia's license plates feature a blue band on the left side of the plate with the EU circle of stars and the country code `EST`. Plates are white with black text: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="EST" format="123 ABC"/>.

# Phone Codes

Estonian telephone numbers are not geographically linked; as such, there is no area code system.

# Highways & Road Numbering Schemes

The Estonian road network is divided into three tiers: _põhimaantee_ (main roads), _tugimaantee_ (basic roads), and _korvalmaantee_ (community roads).

## Main Roads (_Põhimaantee_)

These are the main routes across the country, and are signposted with white text on a red background: <RoadNumber num="7" bgColor="red" />. There appears to be no pattern as to the numbering, although there are only twelve routes that are distinctive on maps.

They are numbered up to 11, plus an outlier in route 92. Routes 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9 extend outwards from Tallinn roughly clockwise, while routes 3, 5, and 7 are lateral routes running through Tartu, Pärnu, and Misso respectively. Route 10 is a disconnected route in the Lääne and Saare counties, and routes 6 and 92 run through the south of the country.

## Basic Roads (_Tugimaantee_)

These roads continue from the main roads numbering, being numbered from 12 to 95 (excluding 92). While there is no discernible pattern to their numbering, they are mostly clustered by their first digit. They are signposted with black text on a yellow background: <RoadNumber num="12" bgColor="gold" borderColor="black" />.

## Community Roads (_Korvalmaantee_)

These roads are signposted with black text on a white background: <RoadNumber num="123" borderColor="black" />. While officially they have five digits, with the first two representing the county, this code does not appear on signs; only the final three digits are used, and so are not unique to the county.

# Language

The official language of Estonia is Estonian, which is a Uralic language of the Finnic branch, and is thus very similar to Finnish. Like Finnish, it has many double-vowel sequences, which is characteristic of the language.

## Script

Estonian uses the Latin alphabet, plus several extra characters:

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk
Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv
Ww Xx Yy Zz Ää Öö Üü Õõ Šš Žž
```

The letters _C_, _Q_, _W_, _X_, and _Y_ are only used for foreign names, while _F_, _Z_, _Š_, and _Ž_ are used for loanwords and foreign names.

## Sample

> Kõik inimesed sünnivad vabadena ja võrdsetena oma väärikuselt ja õigustelt. Neile on antud mõistus ja südametunnistus ja nende suhtumist üksteisesse peab kandma vendluse vaim.
