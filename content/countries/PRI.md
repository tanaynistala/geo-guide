# Geography

## The islands

The main island is Puerto Rico. In the east, Vieques and Culebra are inhabited islands. There are some other uninhabited islands, notably Isla de Mona in the west. Streetview coverage is limited to Puerto Rico island, so the secondary islands are not relevant in geoguessr.

Note : In the west, only the coast and the main yellow roads have streetview coverage.

## San Juan

The capital is San Juan, a huge city in the north-east. The historic center with forts, paved roads and big colonial style buildings is located on la Isla San Juan, north of the main city.

# Roads, Markings, and Signage

## road types

There are 4 categories of roads each with a distinct shield :

- Primary highways numbered 1 to 99, use a blue shield.
- Urban primary highways use a black & white shield : they complement the primary road network in the 8 major cities of the island.
- Secondary highways numbered 100 to 299 use a pentagonal shield.
- Tertiary roads numbered 300 to 9999 use a round shield.

## Numbering system

- Roads 1 to 99 do not follow any particular order.
- Road numbers increase from west to east in the range 100 to 198.
- 199 is south of San Juan.
- then there is an area for roads 200's and 2000's, an area for roads 300's and 3000's....

  On 4 digits roads, the first digit is always the area code. Then the 3 following digits very often refer to a nearby 3 digit road, but it is not always the case.

## road signs

On the most important roads, you will find kilometer signs. if the road passes through San Juan, kilometer 0 is there.
