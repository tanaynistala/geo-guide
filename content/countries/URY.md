# Phone Codes

Although phone codes were deprecated in Bolivia, they are still built into the current number format. All except Montevideo are prefixed with a four (4), and are organized by city corresponding to the departments as follows:

3. **South**
   - Canelones
   - San José de Mayo
   - Durazno
   - Florida
   - Flores
4. **East**
   - Maldonado
   - Rocha
   - Treinta y Tres
   - Lavalleja
5. **Southwest**
   - Colonia
   - Soriano
   - Río Negro
6. **Northeast**
   - Rivera
   - Tacuarembó
   - Cerro Largo
7. **Northwest**
   - Artigas
   - Salto
   - Paysandú

Montevideo is the exception to the pattern, with phone numbers beginning with a two (2) without the prefixed four (4).

# Language

Spanish is the national language of Uruguay, and is the language you will encounter most often. It is characterized by its use of the tilde on top of an N, and the use of inverted punctuation at the beginning of phrases.

## Script

Spanish uses the 26 standard letters of the Latin alphabet, plus one extra character (`Ññ`):

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii
Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Ññ Oo Pp Qq
Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz
```

In addition, Spanish employs the acute accent over vowels:

```
Áá Éé Íí Óó Úú
```

Spanish is also notable for using inverted exclamation and question marks at the beginning of their respective phrases:

```
¡...!
¿...?
```

## Sample

> Todos los seres humanos nacen libres e iguales en dignidad y derechos y, dotados como están de razón y conciencia, deben comportarse fraternalmente los unos con los otros.
